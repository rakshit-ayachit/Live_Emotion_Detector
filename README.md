# Emotion Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to perform emotion detection from facial expressions. It aims to accurately recognize and classify emotions based on real-time input from a webcam.

## Overview

The Emotion Detection project leverages the power of MediaPipe and OpenCV to capture facial expressions from a webcam feed in real time. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze facial landmarks and predict the corresponding emotions. The project focuses on achieving accurate and real-time emotion detection.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset collected using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The dataset includes video frames captured from a webcam along with the corresponding emotions manually labeled by human annotators. The dataset is carefully curated to represent a diverse range of emotions and includes appropriate augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model used for emotion detection is typically based on ML architectures such as random forest, KNN and many more. The model is trained using the collected dataset, which is preprocessed to extract facial landmarks and features. These features are fed into the model to learn the relationship between facial expressions and emotions.

## Data Collection

To collect the dataset, the project utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to access the webcam feed and extract facial landmarks. The facial landmarks are then associated with specific emotions using manual annotation or predefined emotion labels. The collected data is stored for further preprocessing and training the emotion detection model.

## Training

The emotion detection model is trained using the collected dataset. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance. The model is trained using various deep learning techniques, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and regularization, to achieve accurate emotion classification.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using the validation set to measure its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's ability to correctly classify emotions. Additional techniques like cross-validation or k-fold validation may be employed for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## Usage

To use the Emotion Detection project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies.

2. Set up the MediaPipe and OpenCV environment to access the webcam and capture real-time video frames.

3. Preprocess and augment the collected dataset using appropriate techniques to enhance model performance and generalization.

4. Train the deep learning model using the preprocessed dataset. Fine-tune the model architecture and adjust training parameters as necessary.

5. Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset or using real-time webcam feed to assess its performance and accuracy.

6. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can utilize it to perform emotion detection on real-time video frames captured from a webcam. The model will predict the corresponding emotions based on facial expressions.

## Examples and Results

Include examples or screenshots of emotion detection results, showcasing the model's ability to accurately classify emotions in real time. Provide visual representations of the webcam feed along with the predicted emotions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning model.
